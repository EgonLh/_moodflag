st.markdown("<div style='text-align: justify;margin:20px 0px'>Mood swings are sudden and intense changes in emotional state ‚Äî one moment you might feel great, and the next, overwhelmed, irritated, or down. While occasional shifts are normal for everyone, frequent or extreme mood swings can be a sign of deeper mental health challenges like depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder.If your mood changes become too intense or start affecting your daily life, it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúa phase‚Äù ‚Äî it might be time to seek help or support. Early intervention and mental health treatment can make a big difference.That‚Äôs why we built this app ‚Äî to help you track, understand, and predict mood swings based on your daily habits, stress levels, and lifestyle changes. The goal is to raise awareness and encourage people to take care of their mental well-being before things escalate.</div>",unsafe_allow_html=True)

This app uses a combination of personal background, lifestyle patterns, and mental health history to predict potential mood swing risks. By analyzing inputs like work stress, social habits, and previous mental health experiences, it helps identify individuals who might be at higher risk and could benefit from seeking support or treatment.
<br>
<div style='border:1px solid #202124; padding:10px;margin:40px 0px; border-radius: 5px;'>
<b style='color:#bcbcbd;'>We use the following factors for prediction:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Demographics:</b> Gender, Country, Occupation, Self-employed status</li>
<li><b>Mental Health History:</b> Family history, past treatment, previous mental health issues</li>
<li><b>Lifestyle Indicators:</b> Days spent indoors, coping struggles, changes in daily habits</li>
<li><b>Mental Health Awareness:</b> Willingness to attend mental health interviews, knowledge of care options</li>
<li><b>Social & Work Patterns:</b> Interest in work, social weaknesses, increasing stress levels</li>
</div>
All these are captured through a simple form ‚Äî once submitted, our model processes the data and provides a prediction about whether the individual is at high risk of mood swings and may need support.
